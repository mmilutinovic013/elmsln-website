Katrina Wehr is an instructional designer at Penn State’s Smeal College of Business. Katrina graduated from Penn State with a B.S. in secondary education and earned her M.Ed. in instructional design and technology from Kutztown University. She’s interested in helping students and instructors make use of data to improve how concepts are taught, studied and mastered. She prioritizes instructional integrity over technology, and she’s working to promote this mindset among others in the educational technology community.

Katrina took the scenic route to becoming an instructional designer, first working as a journalist, then as a high school English teacher. She got her start as a freelance designer for private companies and K-12 education institutions, and then moved on to Drexel University before returning to Penn State in 2015. Katrina looks forward to extinguishing traditional models of postsecondary education in favor of guiding students and educators toward new paradigms focused on individuals and their unique educational goals and motivations. Ultimately, she is focused on improving educational opportunities for all in the hope that educated citizens in turn focus on improving the world.
