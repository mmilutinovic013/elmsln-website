 Michael Potter is affectionately known as the second most famous Michael Potter in Drupal. What he lacks in neutrino particle physics knowledge he makes up for in crafting sustainable, responsive front-end systems and Drupal websites using the latest techniques and tools. Before coming to Penn State, Michael worked for multiple startups where he used and abused Drupal to quickly prototype ideas and solve technological problems for businesses.  As an educational technologist, he brings that same passion of solving problems with technology to online learning. Michael is also a core developer for the open-source Drupal platform, ELMS Learning Network.
