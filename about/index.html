      <p>Digital media generally refers to the storage and transmission of information in increasingly varied multimedia digital formats and devices, and within a changing array of modes of communication. Design is a means by which we respond to change in a purposeful way by focusing on issues, problems and opportunities and developing plans for taking innovative and strategic actions. Hence digital design shapes and impacts the physical and virtual spaces people inhabit.</p>
      <p>The major is delivered entirely online and the curriculum integrates courses in art and design, information sciences and technology, communications, and general education options. When embedded in problem-based, purpose-driven inquiry the curriculum is dynamic and responsive to individual needs, interests and aspirations. This approach is well suited and expertly supported in the resource rich online environment. Students take a series of prescribed courses in digital multimedia design, supporting courses in related areas, and additional courses drawn from online tracks in visual arts and design, information sciences and technologies, and communications. The content is sequenced in order to be informing and transforming as students move through the degree.</p>
      <p>The DMD major blends disciplinary content, learning approaches, and outcome measures into diverse yet integrated learning experiences. Learning encounters are designed around real-life situations and settings where students make use of creative thinking and critical reasoning to organize their knowledge and ideas and to represent them in a range of visual forms, scenarios, and narrative projects. The content is sequenced in order to be informing and transforming as students move through the degree, and monitored is maintained through the use of digital portfolios* that house student work.</p>
