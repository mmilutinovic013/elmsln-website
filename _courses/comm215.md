title: Basic Photography for Communications
number: COMM 215
description: An introduction to photography as a means of visual communication in the digital age. Students will learn basic picture-taking principles, camera techniques, photographic aesthetics, and the use of digital imaging software. Students will be encouraged to explore photography as an aesthetic, expressive, and socially significant medium. This will be achieved through individual and group critique of each student's photographs, as well as through analysis of examples of the work of prominent photographers. Students will complete a series of assignments that help them learn to produce visual content for a digitally savvy audience. At the end of the semester, students will be able to produce story-telling images as well as write captions for their photographs. They will have a knowledge of the aesthetics of photography, will understand the importance of both form and content, and will have the ability to critically evaluate photographs.
